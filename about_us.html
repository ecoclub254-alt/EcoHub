    <h2>About EcoHub</h2>

    <p class="about-lead">
      EcoHub is a sustainability-driven organization working at the intersection of climate advocacy, engineering, waste management, and community development. We partner with corporates, SMEs, NGOs, and institutions to design and implement practical solutions that balance environmental responsibility with economic and social impact.

We believe sustainability is not an add-on — it is a smarter way of building, operating, and growing.
    </p>

    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        The work is grounded in lived experience — shaped by hands-on engagement
        across water systems, media, community initiatives, and development-focused
        communication.
      </p>

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        EcoHub is a multidisciplinary platform bringing together technical expertise, environmental insight, and community-centered thinking. Our work bridges strategy and execution, helping organizations move from sustainability intentions to measurable action.

We operate with a clear focus: creating solutions that are realistic, scalable, and context-aware, especially within the built environment and emerging economies.
      </p>

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p class="about-lead">
        Climate Advocacy
We promote climate awareness and action through research, partnerships, and advocacy initiatives that influence responsible decision-making at organizational and community levels.

Construction & Engineering Services
We provide sustainability-informed construction and engineering solutions that prioritize efficiency, durability, and environmental performance across projects.

Waste Management Solutions
From waste reduction strategies to sustainable disposal and recovery systems, we help organizations manage waste responsibly and compliantly.

Community Initiatives
We collaborate with communities to develop programs that support environmental education, local resilience, and inclusive participation in sustainability efforts.
      </p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>

    <p class="about-lead">
      At EcoHub, we are guided by three core principles:

Practical Sustainability – Solutions must work in real-world conditions

Collaboration – Strong outcomes come from strong partnerships

Long-Term Impact – We design with the future in mind

This approach allows us to deliver outcomes that are not only environmentally sound but also operationally and economically viable.
